// every class must have a render function
  // it's recommended that you start with a functional based component and
  // only refactor to a class when you need some added functionality

  // This component will render the event creation view where a user can create a new event
    // The info they input will then be sent to the database

    // After an event has been created, the user should be redirected to the eventView for their page
