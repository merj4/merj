import React from 'react';
// every class must have a render function
  // it's recommended that you start with a functional based component and
  // only refactor to a class when you need some added functionality

// This component is basically the manager for the eventItem
  // it controls the layout of the events
  // and controls rendering the layout of the events based on filters, too

  // The components that get passed into this are eventItem

  // Will have to be a class component to handle changing state
