// every class must have a render function
  // it's recommended that you start with a functional based component and
  // only refactor to a class when you need some added functionality

  // This component strictly handles getting info from the database and rendering it
  // This gets passed into eventView (along with chat) to create the complete eventView

  // The DB info that will get rendered here is the event name, place and host name

  // This probably doesn't need to handle any changing state and could just be a regular component
