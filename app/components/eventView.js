// every class must have a render function
  // it's recommended that you start with a functional based component and
  // only refactor to a class when you need some added functionality

  // This is where a single event view will be managed
    // I imagine this will need to be a class component because it will need to handle changing state from the chat controller

  // Chat will also be passed into this so it can be rendered, too
