### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

```sh
npm install
npm start
nodemon server.js
```

Fork and clone the respository to your local machine. Use npm install to install the required dependencies. To start the app you can use: npm run build or npm start which builds then runs the app. Run the local server using node server.js or nodemon server.js.

Point your browser to localhost:8080 and have fun!

We used Auth0 for authentication and Google Maps API, which you will need to obtain your own API Key to use within the app.
